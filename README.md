I am trying to learn about AI, Neural Network, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Before I start taking actual courses on them, I would like to experiment and find out how the entire thing work

This project contains a mini AI program that takes in a number and predicts whether the number is odd or even. I know normally you can just use 
```
    var is_even = number % 2
```
and you will get the result, but I just wanna see how to actually build one
